# Voice based Gender classification 

This work is inspired from the dataset provided by [Kory Beckar (primaryobjects)](https://github.com/primaryobjects/voice-gender) (posted on Kaggle).

The dataset contains low level attributes of voice samples extracted from 
`seewave` library in R.

This was an initial experiment to obtain the baseline accuracy in voice based classification tasks (and gender classification is one of the easiest to start with). 

### Data 
voice.csv in the data/ folder

### Code
A jupyter notebook containing different scikit models and their baseline accuracy on the dataset.
